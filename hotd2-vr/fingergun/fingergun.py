"""
Finger guns for Flycast's emulated light gun, tracked with a webcam (MediaPipe).

  aim     move / point your finger gun at the screen
  fire    drop your thumb onto your index finger, like the hammer of a finger gun
  reload  open your hand for a moment (spread the other fingers): an off-screen shot.
          --reload down: the old way, point the gun down or leave the view below.
  start   thumbs-up (a fist, thumb up) for half a second: the game's Start (join, pause).
          On by default with two players (--start-gesture on to use it alone too).

Two players (--players 2): two people side by side in front of one webcam, one gun hand
each; whoever is on the left of the preview is player 1 (red crosshair), on the right
player 2 (light blue). Each has their own calibration (settings_2p_p1/p2.json).

Ways to aim (m cycles): personal (default after a calibration: where your hand is and how
it is turned, combined the way you aimed at nine calibration points, like a ray from your
finger to the screen), mix (both measurements averaged), hand position only and gun
direction only. The calibration measures all of them at once. Keys in the preview window:

  k        guided calibration: centre, edges, corners, then three test shots
  c        quick re-centre: aim at the centre of the game screen and press c
  1 2      two players: which player the keys act on
  K C      two players: calibrate both (one after the other) / re-centre everyone in view
  s        Start for the chosen player (instead of the thumbs-up)
  [ ]      more / less movement needed for the same crosshair travel (calmer / snappier)
  t g      trigger more / less sensitive
  m        aiming: personal -> mix -> hand position -> gun direction
  x        marker on/off in session.csv (e.g. around a stretch where you don't shoot)
  i        the webcam's own settings (e.g. switch off "low light compensation": in a dim
           room many webcams halve their frame rate to expose longer)
  q, Esc   quit

Sends "LG <player> <x> <y> <buttons>" datagrams (x, y in 1/10000ths of the screen) to
Flycast's UDP light gun input (vr.UdpPort, 127.0.0.1 only). Only one tracker runs at a
time. Remembers calibration in settings.json; writes status.json (twice a second) and
session.csv (every frame): numbers only, no images.

    Thumb trigger that adapts to the hand pose. The thumb's "open" distance seen by the

    let go once it comes back up from its lowest point.

    Finger tilted up steeply (median pitch of the last 3 frames below --steep-deg): the
    camera can't see the thumb behind the index finger any more and MediaPipe guesses it
    lying against the finger, which reads as pressed. In that pose the trigger keeps its
    own open level, and a drop only arms a shot: it fires when the thumb comes back up
    within --return-time (a real tap does; a hidden thumb mostly stays "down"). Frames
    where the tilt jumps more than --jump-deg are misreads and start no press. Replayed on
    two real sessions: suspect presses aiming up 10 -> 4, held (stuck) presses at the top
    1.3 -> 0.3 s, every deliberate press kept; level-finger shots unchanged (+~4 ms), steep
