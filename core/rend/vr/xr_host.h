/*
	OpenXR host (hotd2-vr): turns the Android build into an immersive Quest app.

	The emulator keeps producing frames at the game's own rate. The render thread paces
	itself on the headset instead (xrWaitFrame), lets those frames through, and draws the
	latest one once per eye with the reprojection from rend/vr_reproject.h, so head
	movement is tracked at the display rate. The right controller is the light gun.
